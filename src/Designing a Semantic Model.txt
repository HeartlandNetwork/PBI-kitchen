| Designing a Semantic Model |

Getting Ready
-------------

Decision points - Direct Query vs in-memory - limited prototype to generate initial visualizations
Avoiding version control issues - have one main model - source of truth - One model - many reports 

Be methodical - what are top pain points - what are unanswered business questions in current state 
Do an assessment of feasibility and complexity - e.g., data quality a dn analytical needs
Target realistic and sustainable deliverables

Power BI semantic models - dimension modeling and star schema - short collaberative meetinds with 
stakeholders 

Four-step dimensional design process:

(1) Choose the business processes: Number and nature of processes - include scale of sources, scope
of project - process examples - planning, sales, time reporting, general ledger, others

(2) Declare the granularity: For each process (fact), define the meaning of each row - clear, concise
business definitions. Each fact - one grain. Consider scalability limitations of Power BI Desktop - balance
needs between detail and history - e.g. more history and less granularity or visa verse. Examples - 
(a) one row per sales order - granularity at sales order line vs purchase order header - granulariyt 

one row per general ledger account balance per fiscal month

(3) Identify the dimensions:

(4) Identify the facts:



How to design a semantic model
------------------------------

(1) Create a data warehouse bus matrix:

(2) Create an implementation bus matrix:

(3) Choose the sematic model storage mode - import, DirectQuery or composite
